Overview:
This GitHub project focuses on analyzing sales data from an online electronics store. The dataset consists of 12 different files, each representing sales data for different months. The primary goal is to combine these individual files into a consolidated dataset, preprocess the data, and perform a comprehensive analysis.

Project Structure:

Files can be in various formats such as CSV, Excel, or other commonly used data formats.
Data Consolidation:

Merge the 12 individual files into a single, unified dataset.
Ensure consistency in column names and data types across all files.
Handle any missing or inconsistent data during the consolidation process.
Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the combined dataset.
Address issues like missing values, outliers, or duplicate entries.
Convert data types as needed.
Standardize or normalize relevant columns.
Data Analysis:

Utilize descriptive statistics to gain insights into the overall sales performance.
Explore key metrics such as total revenue, average order value, and popular products.
Identify trends and patterns in sales data over the 12-month period.
Visualization:

Employ the Matplotlib library to create meaningful visualizations.
Generate graphs and charts to illustrate trends, seasonality, and outliers.
Provide visual representations of key performance indicators.
Graphical Analysis:
